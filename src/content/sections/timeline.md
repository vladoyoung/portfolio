    content: "After finding out that Accounting was not for me in High School, I decided to look into something else, and that something was the thing I was using every day - the web! My first interest in HTML and CSS was eye-opening. After my first steps in learning the basics I started experimenting with my own little projects and soon I was helping my school with their website and content management!"

    content: "I've always helped my dad with his catering business as an actual first job but for my first relevant opportunity I got the chance to work in a local web agency. A friend of mine reached out and got me in touch with the CEO of the company. They were impressed with what I can do so far and offered me a remote part-time job! I worked on simple HTML, CSS, JS and PHP mockup-to-website projects which gave me a good initial boost in my career!"

    content: "I was accepted in the five universities I applied to actually, but I chose Bradford because the degree I was about to take was prestigious there at the time, and the city is also comfortably cheap for a foreign Bulgarian student! Here I started forming some of my best memories, experiences and connections!"

    emoji: "ü¶æ"
    content: "In my first year of university I started my first freelance job as a Data Entry and Virtual Assistant in my cousin's merch business, learning a lot about content and data management, SEO, marketing and business management. My second year at uni comprised of heavy assignments and me taking up a Project Manager role in the university's digital academy. There I had the rewarding experience of managing a small team of graphic designers while collaborating with the Bradford City Council. I also spun up my own little merch dropshipping business! In my third year I focused on my final project, whilst starting as a Freelance Web Developer in my friend and lecturer's firm. Throughout the years I tried archery and picked up volleyball, playing as a middle hitter in the university team. In July 2019 I graduated with first class honours! üéâ"

Utilising my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla and ES6), AJAX, PHP, Git, Gulp/Grunt and NPM, I played a key role in creating bespoke websites that are visually appealing, functionally robust and tailored to meet the specific needs of clients."

Managing the codebase through peer- reviews on Github and Bitbucket and leveraging CMS platforms such as Contentful and Storyblok through RESTful and GraphQL APIs. Additionally, I managed projects from start to finish (KANBAN), developing skills in time management, emotional intelligence, and exceeding client expectations.
