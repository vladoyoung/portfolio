Excel is a family-run manufacturer that specialises in high-quality, made-to-measure blinds. As the brand continues to grow and expands into larger premises, it required a striking rebrand and a more customer-friendly website to better reflect its product offering as well as highlight long-standing core business values.

### The challenge

Excel approached The Bigger Boat requiring help to market the business, particularly in terms of social media activity. However, we spotted a disparity between the professionalism and calibre of the company and its products and its existing website. We advised that although a good social media strategy would indeed drive brand awareness and traffic, it would prove ineffective if the website wasn’t performing as it should.

Excel got on board with a design brief for a new website and it was agreed the new site should prioritise smooth functionality and simple but eye-catching design. Excel was keen to showcase its product and industry expertise without losing an inherent pride for its Yorkshire heritage.

### The solution

With extensive experience in marketing for the manufacturing sector, we quickly identified the need for a website overhaul to better communicate Excel’s expertise and unrivalled product and customer service offering. By understanding the customer type, their preferred online journey and which marketing activities prove most successful, we were able to deliver an online hub of information that Excel can now use to drive their business forward. 

We designed a site that reflects the breadth of Excel’s product offering with large, hi-res imagery. We also made improvements to the site structure, updated content and included clear calls to action – all of which allow for a better customer journey after landing on the website and has already increased their organic rank in Google.
