Excel, a family-owned blinds manufacturer known for crafting premium, custom-made blinds, was in need of a comprehensive rebrand and a user-friendly website as it embarked on expansion and moved to larger facilities. The aim was to create a strong visual identity that accurately showcases its range of products and emphasizes the enduring core values of the business.

### The challenge

Excel was seeking assistance in enhancing their marketing efforts, especially in the realm of social media. While addressing this need, we at The Bigger Boat identified a mismatch between the company's professionalism and product quality and the existing state of their website. We recommended that while implementing a robust social media strategy would certainly elevate brand awareness and website traffic, it would not yield optimal results if the website itself didn't meet industry standards.

Recognizing the importance of a holistic approach, Excel collaborated with us on a design brief for a new website. Our collective understanding was to develop a website that excelled in both seamless functionality and captivating yet uncomplicated design. Excel's priority was to effectively present their products and industry expertise while proudly reflecting their Yorkshire heritage.

### The solution

Leveraging our extensive experience in marketing within the manufacturing sector, we swiftly recognized the necessity for a comprehensive website transformation to effectively convey Excel's profound expertise, unparalleled products, and top-notch customer service. By delving into customer preferences, their desired online experience, and pinpointing the most effective marketing strategies, we successfully crafted an online hub of valuable information that now empowers Excel to propel their business growth.

Our design approach entailed creating a website that mirrors the extensive range of Excel's products, enriched with vibrant high-resolution images. We also streamlined the site's structure, updated its content, and integrated clear calls to action. These strategic enhancements have significantly enhanced the customer journey post-landing on the website, contributing to an improved organic ranking on Google.
