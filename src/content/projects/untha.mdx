UNTHA UK is the top maker of industrial shredders in the country. They wanted a new website to show why they're the best, offering advanced technology and machines for industrial shredding. We started with a workshop to plan the customer's journey, listened to important people and focused on what UNTHA's customers need.

### The challenge

The website had to work well on mobile devices, be simple to use, and be able to grow as needed. It also had to show that UNTHA is a top brand with advanced technology. They had big plans and needed a website and platform to help reach their goals.

In the future, the company wanted to gather and analyze more data to create better communication with current and future customers.

### The solution

After conducting a workshop involving key team members, we designed a user flow for the website with our design and development teams. Using insights from the workshop and keyword research, we planned the website's structure to improve its visibility on search engines and fulfill the needs of UNTHA UK's customers.

The result? A visually appealing website with images and videos that also functions well technically. Notable features include a "shredder finder" tool for easy product navigation based on application type and a resource center.

The product pages are rich in content, including sections for application details, resources, customer testimonials, and interactive animations for exploring the machines in depth.

We built the website to integrate directly with UNTHA UK's CRM, Microsoft Dynamics, allowing us to track the entire customer journey and the value of leads generated through various marketing channels.
