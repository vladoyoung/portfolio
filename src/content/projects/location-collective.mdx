### The challenge

When Location Collective came to us for a rebranding, they had a clear objective in mind. As a well-established market leader, they aimed to develop a brand identity that showcased their deep commitment and knowledge in the film industry. Location Collective's ultimate goal is to transform London into the most film-friendly destination globally.

### The solution

We at The Bigger Boat aimed to infuse Location Collective's deep appreciation and expertise in the film industry into every aspect of their brand identity. Our created brand identity includes iconic lines from well-known movies, often with a playful twist to align with the brand's character. This approach was intended to resonate with the target audience, who would appreciate our subtle references to the film world.

The new logo mark also incorporates a classic film quote. The 'negative space' X in the logo draws inspiration from the frequently used line 'X marks the spot,' a phrase seen in various films like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. We designed a timeless and impactful typographic style and color palette that conveys our message with clarity and quickly becomes associated with the brand.
