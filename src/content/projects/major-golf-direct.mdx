### The challenge

The pandemic introduced significant instability to the golf market. During lockdown, participation hit record lows, but it rebounded swiftly once restrictions eased. In this uncertain environment, a strongly ranked organic website could aid the client in navigating quieter periods and thriving when participation surged. To address this, Major Golf Direct aimed to enhance its organic visibility and overall revenue. We initiated optimizations to the site and conducted trials with user experience (UX) and conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategies to consistently boost conversions.

### The solution

The website's structure was well-organized, featuring smart categorization and a clear hierarchy. Our task was to enhance what was already in place.

Upon discussing with the client, we focused on optimizing specific categories to achieve higher rankings in anticipation of the upcoming summer season. We enriched and refined content on these pages, including meta data. We also conducted an overall site review and integrated internal links to assist with crawl budget and the flow of authority. Furthermore, we engaged in minor link building to enhance the site's authority.

Additionally, we addressed various technical issues. The website had over 120,000 redirect chains, which were manually checked and resolved. We also tackled common e-commerce problems like duplication and cannibalization. These straightforward remedies – boosting authority, refining crawl budget, and enhancing relevancy – yielded remarkably positive outcomes.
