Escape Studios is one of the UK's premier VFX, animation and games art training and teaching institutions. It’s been at the forefront of creative education since 2002, supplying the industry with studio-ready talent. The task was to design and build an engaging website that champions accessibility, using Storyblok’s CMS to integrate with existing sales and lead generation software.

### The challenge

Escape Studios wanted a new website to show its courses, products, and events in a more interactive and interesting way. The old website was made for two different schools - Escape Studios (for creative courses) and Pearson Business School (for business). This made it a bit confusing for both groups of people. The website was also built using the Adobe Experience Manager tool, which made it difficult to make changes to the website easily.

The new website needed to be really easy for everyone to use and understand. Our aim was to make sure students would want to keep coming back to the website to get information about courses and helpful stuff. It also had to be simple for new visitors, and our marketing team should find it easy to make changes to the website.

### The solution

Renowned as one of the top-rated training and teaching centers in the UK for animation, games, and VFX, we added subtle references to gaming elements like keyboard keys, language, retro buttons, and loading bars reminiscent of computer games. We chose a darker appearance with splashes of color, shifting the focus to the student work at the forefront.

Now, the Storyblok CMS gives the Escape Studios team more control, making content creation easier and the website more uniform for customers. They focused on customer journeys, SEO, user experience, and digital accessibility right from the beginning. This helps their online presence match up better with other educational institutions and industry partners. The website is now more interesting and both potential and current students find it simpler to get to the pages they want.
