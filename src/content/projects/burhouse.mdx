After unveiling a new website to cater to a broader clientele, Burhouse, a supplier of jewelry findings and settings, recognized the necessity to revamp its social media platforms in order to harmonize with the firm's digital interactions. The goal was to establish a uniform customer experience.

### The challenge

Burhouse sought our assistance in combining its two brands, 'Beadhouse' and 'Burhouse Ltd,' to establish a streamlined website and customer journey. This integration extended to social media messaging, aiming to enhance engagement on various platforms.

The primary goal was to equip the team with the capability to create compelling content internally. This content needed to not only maintain the interest of existing customers but also attract a broader, expanding audience.

### The solution

We at The Bigger Boat conducted a comprehensive analysis of Burhouse's competitors and reviewed all their active and inactive social media accounts. To support Burhouse, we developed a user-friendly social media content template tailored to their needs. Alongside this, we presented the findings from our analysis and a thorough social media audit, providing essential insights and actionable recommendations. This empowered Burhouse to independently and effectively execute the strategy.
