BABY born, a prominent doll manufacturer, crafts an enchanting realm of exploration and imagination for kids. These dolls are crafted to accompany children from infancy, becoming their cherished companions throughout their formative years.

BABY born entrusted us with the creation of a fresh website and a unique tone of expression, setting them apart from their sibling brand, Baby Annabell. Our responsibilities extended to developing an enduring digital marketing approach, defining the range of content to be offered, and overseeing their social media marketing initiatives.

### The challenge

We was chosen to design and release a fresh website for the BABY born brand due to our established partnership with Little Tikes. Once the website went live, BABY born extended their collaboration with us to execute digital marketing plans, expand their content range, and handle their social media presence. Our primary goals were to enhance brand recognition, boost user interaction, and ensure that BABY born's digital efforts secured its top position in the industry.

### The solution

We collaborated closely with the client through brand immersion sessions and conducted thorough market research to gain a precise understanding of BABY born, its audience, goals, and unique strengths. Using a mobile-first approach, we designed and developed a website that ensures a seamless checkout process, catering to customers who prefer shopping and consuming content on mobile devices. We also established comprehensive tone of voice guidelines that set BABY born apart in the market, and all the content we produce adheres to this distinct character and style.

Our efforts led to the launch of the BABY born blog, serving as a hub for insights, updates, and play inspiration. We continue to manage BABY born's social media marketing, elevating its presence across relevant social platforms and implementing impactful seasonal campaigns that captivate its followers. Some notable campaigns include organizing an extensive Easter egg hunt on the website, and with 2021 marking the brand's 30th anniversary, we've managed announcements and are planning surprises throughout the year to celebrate this milestone.
