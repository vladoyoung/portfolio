BABY born is a leading doll manufacturer and creator of a world of adventure and discovery for children. Its dolls are designed for children from newborn – their first best friend to join them in their journey through childhood.

BABY born tasked us with creating a new website and a distinctive tone of voice to differentiate from sister brand Baby Annabell, as well as implement ongoing digital marketing strategy, scope out its content offering and manage its social media marketing.

### The challenge

The Bigger Boat was handpicked to create and launch a new website for the BABY born brand thanks to our long-standing relationship with Little Tikes. Website live, BABY born required us to implement digital marketing strategies, build out a content offering and manage its social media – all with the objectives of raising brand awareness, improving user engagement and generally ensuring BABY born’s digital activity put the brand exactly where it should be in its sector: at the top of its game.

### The solution

We worked closely with the client in brand immersion sessions and carried out thorough market research to precisely understand BABY born and its audience, objectives and unique selling points. We designed and built a website with a mobile-first approach and hassle-free checkout process, as we know the brands’ customers like to shop and consume content on the go. We created detailed tone of voice guidelines to differentiate BABY born in the marketplace and every piece of content we create adheres to the brand’s distinctive character and sound.

We’ve launched the BABY born blog, which serves as a hub of insights, updates and play inspiration. We continue to manage BABY born’s social media marketing, raising the brand’s profile across relevant social platforms and implementing effective seasonal campaigns that engage its following. Memorable campaigns include launching a big Easter egg hunt across the website and 2021 marks the brand’s 30th anniversary so we managed the announcements and continue to plan for surprises throughout the remainder of the year.
