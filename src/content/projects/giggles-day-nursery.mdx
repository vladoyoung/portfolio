### The challenge

In anticipation of its growth plans, Giggles Day Nursery recognized the necessity for a refreshed brand identity that resonates with its child-centric yet professional ethos. With communication playing an increasingly vital role for parents, establishing a strong online presence became a central objective for the brand.

In pursuit of this goal, Giggles Day Nursery embarked on a search for someone that could wholeheartedly engage with the brand and its industry. The aim was to design a distinctive logo, develop a website, and create custom illustrations that would deeply resonate with parents. Ultimately, the overarching objective of the project was to present Giggles Day Nursery with an updated and enhanced image that would attract and reassure a greater number of customers than ever before.

### The solution

Following initial discussions, we at The Bigger Boat started to enhance Giggles Day Nursery's brand identity and website, elevating its overall image. We developed a vibrant and joyful brand identity, building upon the existing recognizable characters to create a new set of characters portrayed in various poses. These characters were prominently featured across marketing materials to enhance brand recognition, boost engagement, and drive inquiries. With the brand identity established, we shifted our focus to the website development.

We recognized that a headless content management system (CMS) would be the ideal solution, given its user-friendly interface and intuitive design. The advantages of a headless website encompass improved speed, enhanced user experience, and the ability for smaller businesses to essentially future-proof their websites without the need for frequent updates or migrations. Additionally, considering that parents often use the website's inquiry form, sharing information about themselves and their children, security became of paramount importance to ensure Giggles Day Nursery and its clientele feel secure. A headless CMS functions by separating the front-end and back-end components, preventing unauthorized access to data and content through the front-end of the website. This approach ensures the protection of sensitive information regarding parents and children.

We swiftly crafted an industry-leading headless website with easy navigation. This website featured adorable characters, informative resources, and interactive videos showcasing children at play. This combination effectively communicated Giggles Day Nursery as the premier childcare provider in the Leeds area.
