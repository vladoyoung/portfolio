### The challenge

In preparation for its expansion, Giggles Day Nursery needed a revamped brand identity to reflect its child-friendly yet professional image. Communication has become more important than ever to parents, making online presence was a key priority for the brand.

As such, Giggles Day Nursery sought an agency that would fully immerse itself in the brand and industry to create a unique logo, website and bespoke illustrations that would speak volumes to an audience of parents. The overall aim of the project was to present a new and improved face for Giggles Day Nursery in order to attract and assure more customers than ever before.

### The solution

We were chosen after careful research from the client, which found us to be a fun yet professional brand – much like the desired image of Giggles Day Nursery – and specialists in rebranding and web design. 

After an initial discussion, we were officially brought onboard to build Giggles Day Nursery’s brand identity and website, taking its image to the next level. We created a fun-filled identity, evolving the existing characters the brand is known for to create a new set of four, which can be seen in different poses. They have appeared across marketing and promotional material to build awareness, improve engagement and increase enquiries. Once the identity was in place, we began working on the website.

Given the popularity of the brand’s three nurseries, it became clear that Giggles Day Nursery needed a site that could be easily updated and managed around busy work schedules. 

We knew a headless CMS would be perfect for this task, given its high levels of intuition and simple-to-use structure. The benefits of a headless website are vast and include improved speed, greater user experience and allow smaller businesses to essentially future proof their websites, without ever needing to update or migrate. In addition to this, given that parents often use the website’s enquiry form and include information about themselves and their children, we knew that security would be absolutely vital to offering Giggles Day Nursery and its customers peace of mind. Headless CMSs work by separating the front and back end, meaning data and content cannot be accessed through the front end of the website. This approach effectively protects any sensitive information about parents or children. 

As an official Storyblok CMS partner, we quickly designed and built an industry-leading, easy-to-navigate headless website, filled with cute characters, informational resources, and interactive videos of playing children to effectively communicate Giggles Day Nursery as the childcare provider of the Leeds area.
