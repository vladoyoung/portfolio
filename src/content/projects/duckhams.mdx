Duckhams has been a part of the lubricants industry for more than 100 years. They make products for all sorts of cars – from new ones to really old ones, and even for Formula 1 racing teams. Because they have such a long and impressive history, they wanted a new website that looked and worked really well. They wanted it to show that they are one of the best in their industry.

### The challenge

Duckhams wanted a new website that looked modern but still showed their long history. They also wanted to give their business clients a cool new feature. This feature would let them find the closest place to buy the right oil for their customers' cars. All they needed was the car's registration number. The website also had to show Duckhams' story, which goes back more than 100 years.

One important group of people they wanted to help were car repair shops in the UK. So, the website had to be like a quick guide to all the different oils Duckhams makes. It also had to help the shops find the right oil for whatever car they were working on.

### The solution

We at The Bigger Boat wanted to make a website that Duckhams could easily change later on. So, we used blocks that they could use again and again to make different parts of the site. We also added cool animations and smooth movements to make the site look really good.

We made three special things for the website: an oil finder that lets people find the right oil for their car using their license plate or choosing some options, a map that shows where people can buy Duckhams' products, and a timeline that shows Duckhams' history in an interesting way.

We had to make sure that people who own repair shops could find the 'oil finder' in just two seconds after they opened the website. So, we put a big button in three easy-to-see places.

This new website is the first of about 25 that will be used all around the world – in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. That's why we made the website in a way that will make it easier to use the same things for the other websites later on.
