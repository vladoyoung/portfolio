In 2020 and 2021 respectively, Location Collective – London’s leading provider of space to the film and TV industry – opened OMA Studio Group, the largest film studio group inside London. Here, we discuss our task of creating a website that will help build awareness of this revolutionary space and provide the film industry with crucial technical information.

### The challenge

Location Collective is London’s leading provider of space to the film and TV production industry. Whatever you’re binge-watching right now, chances are it has one of Location Collective’s expertly managed locations at the heart of your favourite scenes.

But not all of their locations are found ‘out and about’. In addition to their locations in and around London, Location Collective has a film studio campus comprising several buildings within easy access from each other, named OMA Studio Group. Bringing together over 368,000 sq ft of high specification sound stage and production support space, OMA Studio Group boasts unrivalled facilities.

With so much need-to-know technical information surrounding the film studios and what they provide, a dedicated OMA Studio Group website was needed to let the world know about their owned studio division, which has grown alongside their agency business in the last couple of years.

### The solution

With such vast production support spaces conveniently located in Enfield, North London (including 10 fully soundproofed stages totalling 242,000 sq ft) it’s crucial that these impressive benefits and technical details are easily discoverable by industry professionals – and clearly outlined. 

To address this, we created pages for each site within OMA Studio Group. Each site page provides an overview of the sites encompassed within it, travel information, and more. Drilling down into this further, one crucial feature we worked on is an interactive campus map showing the studio broken down into the different stages, with specs for each one – including ceiling height and electricity supply.

### Top-level navigation

Using the top-level navigation, users can either explore the studio spaces by site, or by type (i.e. stages / support spaces / offices). This ensures busy industry professionals can quickly and easily discover their ideal space, with all relevant technical information clearly laid out.

Location Collective is a long-standing client of TBB. We’re proud to have created the Location Collective brand and website, and are excited to play a small part in their OMA Studio Group venture.
