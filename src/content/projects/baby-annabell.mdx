Baby Annabell holds the position of being the leading nurturing doll brand in the UK, and it strongly promotes the concept of learning through doll play during crucial early childhood years.

Recognizing our expertise, the brand approached us to develop a fresh online presence that sets it apart from its sister brand BABY born. Additionally, we at The Bigger Boat embarked on crafting a digital strategy that evolves on a month-to-month basis to further enhance the brand's online presence.

### The challenge

Baby Annabell goes beyond creating dolls. It actively supports and fosters nurturing roleplay through its doll range, contributing to the development of traits such as responsibility, kindness, and empathy in young children. Our objective was to effectively convey this message through a freshly designed website and to reflect it accurately in our tone of voice guidelines.

### The solution

Collaborating closely with the Baby Annabell team to deeply comprehend the brand's core values and aspirations helped us understand the design and all subsequent content creation. Through these sessions, we determined color schemes, typography choices, and icon styles. Baby Annabell's new mobile-first website boasts simplified menus, user-friendly shopping cues, and a streamlined checkout process. Our comprehensive tone of voice guidelines now serve as a consistent framework for all digital content.

Within the Baby Annabell blog, producing content that fosters nurturing play and imparts knowledge about the developmental advantages of doll play is key. Concurrently, ongoing social media management endeavors continue to elevate brand awareness and engage Baby Annabell enthusiasts and potential customers.
