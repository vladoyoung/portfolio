Baby Annabell is the UK’s number one nurturing doll brand and a huge advocate of learning through doll play in those important early years.  

The brand reached out to us to create a new home, add real distinction from sister brand BABY born and work on month-to-month digital strategy.

### The challenge

We worked closely with the team at Baby Annabell to thoroughly understand the brand’s values and objectives to then apply this to website design and all content going forward. These immersion sessions informed our decisions as to colour palettes, typography and iconography. Baby Annabell’s new mobile-first website benefits from simplified menus, helpful prompts for shoppers and a hassle-free checkout process. We also created detailed tone of voice guidelines, which we can now apply to content across all digital activity.

Our Baby Annabell blog is home to regular content that inspires nurturing play and educates about the developmental benefits of doll play, while our ongoing social media management continues to raise brand awareness and engage Baby Annabell fans and prospective customers. We’ve helped Baby Annabell reach 10k followers on Instagram, launched its sustainability campaign and announced and managed the brand’s Ask the Expert campaign on Instagram, which heard from various child development and play experts and answered followers’ parenting questions and dilemmas.

### The solution

We worked closely with the client in brand immersion sessions and carried out thorough market research to precisely understand BABY born and its audience, objectives and unique selling points. We designed and built a website with a mobile-first approach and hassle-free checkout process, as we know the brands’ customers like to shop and consume content on the go. We created detailed tone of voice guidelines to differentiate BABY born in the marketplace and every piece of content we create adheres to the brand’s distinctive character and sound.

We’ve launched the BABY born blog, which serves as a hub of insights, updates and play inspiration. We continue to manage BABY born’s social media marketing, raising the brand’s profile across relevant social platforms and implementing effective seasonal campaigns that engage its following. Memorable campaigns include launching a big Easter egg hunt across the website and 2021 marks the brand’s 30th anniversary so we managed the announcements and continue to plan for surprises throughout the remainder of the year.
