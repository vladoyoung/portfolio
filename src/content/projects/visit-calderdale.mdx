Collaborating with Calderdale Council and Visit England, Visit Calderdale is a Yorkshire-based business with the shared goal of boosting tourism and film-making in the local region. Given the continuous evolution of the area's events, attractions, and activities for visitors, Visit Calderdale recognized the need for a fresh, mobile-responsive website to efficiently convey its brand and entice users to explore partner and event websites.

### The challenge

Given that over 60% of Visit Calderdale's website traffic originates from mobile devices, developing a highly mobile-responsive website was of paramount importance to exceed the client's goals.

Furthermore, the existing website's content management system (CMS), Magento 1, was approaching its end of support, necessitating an effective solution to maintain the brand's online presence and digital success.

### The solution

Our initial step involved selecting a new content management system (CMS) in anticipation of Magento 1's impending end of support. Following discussions with the client, we at The Bigger Boat determined that WordPress was the optimal choice due to its user-friendly interface and capability to handle an extensive collection of blog articles. Moreover, WordPress could be seamlessly integrated with WooCommerce, a requirement for Visit Calderdale to effectively present the region's constantly evolving attractions and events.

In our design process, we adopted a mobile-first approach, focusing on the smallest screens first. This approach allowed us to identify any potential constraints posed by smaller viewports and ensured that critical components of the website (primarily for event and attraction bookings) were impeccably presented for users on those screen sizes. It also provided an opportunity to eliminate any elements that weren't essential, contributing to a smooth user experience and streamlined navigation.
