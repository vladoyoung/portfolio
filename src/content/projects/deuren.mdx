Deuren is a luxury door manufacturer with more than 25 years’ experience providing the best in quality from the finest materials. With such customisable products, and a wide array of industry-specific resources, Deuren needed a website which was as versatile and beautiful as its doors.

### The challenge

Deuren needed a revamped website to better position itself as an industry expert among its self-builder, architect and property developer audience, as well as showcase the technical superiority of its bespoke, luxury products.

This called for a host of new functionalities and feature points to clearly communicate Deuren’s expertise while allowing room for future growth in terms of website structure and content. We knew immediately that a ‘headless’ approach to the build would be extremely rewarding.

### The solution

With Deuren having been a client of TBB for over 10 years, we firstly reviewed the wealth of data at our disposal, furthering our understanding of the business and market. We identified what works, what doesn’t and which leads were most valuable to the business, using Zoho CRM. We spent time analysing user behaviour and usage of the site using Hotjar’s Heatmap software, as well as carefully researched the very best in user experience practices. We then hosted a strategy workshop with the client and relevant internal teams, allowing us to pull historical data together alongside a new creative brief to inform the structure of the project.

We chose to build the website using a new and innovative framework: headless. This detached front end and CMS structure provides significant speed benefits over a traditional CMS.

It also allows the design and dev teams ultimate control over the design and user experience of the front-end website. An extensive list of benefits of headless also includes maximised security, zero maintenance and unrivalled flexibility. A headless CMS was crucial to building truly bespoke elements and achieving Deuren’s ambitions for a best-in-class website, with no compromise on speed. We ensured a sound SEO migration strategy was implemented to protect rank as much as possible, while a post go-live PPC plan was put in place to ensure lead generation continued after launch.
