Deuren is a company that makes high-end doors. They've been doing it for over 25 years and they're known for using the best materials to make top-quality doors. Because their doors can be customized a lot and they have many resources for different industries, they needed a website that's as flexible and good-looking as their doors.

### The challenge

Deuren wanted a new and improved website that would make them look like experts in the eyes of people who build their own homes, architects, and property developers. They also wanted to show how their luxury custom-made products are better than others.

To do this, they needed new things on their website, like features and points that would clearly show how good Deuren is at what they do. They also needed space to grow the website more in the future, adding more things to how it's set up and the stuff they show. We quickly realized that using a headless approach to build the website would be a smart choice.

### The solution

First, we looked at all the data we had about them, which helped us understand their business and the market better. We figured out what was working, what wasn't, and which leads were most important to them using Zoho CRM. We also studied how people were using the website with Heatmap software from Hotjar and researched the best ways to make the site user-friendly. Then we had a meeting with the client and the teams inside the company to plan what we would do. We used the old information together with new ideas to plan out the project.

We decided to make the website using a different and new way: headless. This means the front part of the website and the CMS part are separate. This way of doing it makes the website much faster than usual.

It also gives the design and development teams a lot of control over how the website looks and how people use it. There are many benefits to using a headless system. It's more secure, needs less maintenance, and gives us a lot of flexibility. Using this was really important to make special parts of the website and to make sure Deuren gets the best website possible, without it being slow. We made sure to also plan how to keep their rank in search results when we launched the new site. And after the site was live, we had a plan to keep getting new leads through online ads.
