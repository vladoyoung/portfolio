Established in 2009, Roq helps organisations realise the benefits of high-functioning, high-quality software applications, delivered at a pace that aligns with their business imperatives. With the business rapidly progressing, Roq felt the time was right to boost brand visibility and tasked TBB with a brand evolution, featuring a new website as a core element.

### The challenge

Roq is an engineering consultancy that provides an independent view on all things quality to the world’s largest organisations. To demonstrate that high-quality and meet its medium-term objectives, Roq’s brand and website must be an educational resource and effective tool for brand promotion and lead generation, reflecting a company four times its current size.

As a people-focused organisation, Roq’s new brand and website would also need to demonstrate its inclusive, values-driven approach to attract new employees, promoting the company as an employer of choice and a great place to work. Owing to a recommendation by another business, Roq approached The Bigger Boat knowing they’d be in safe hands.

### The solution

To guide Roq towards its vision, we held a brand workshop and content audit. A big takeaway from these was to ensure Roq’s people are at the forefront of the brand. We spent the day at Roq HQ capturing the team going about their day, to show real people with real personalities behind the brand.

From all this, we pinned down Roq’s brand personality, values, and reason for being, which informed the refreshed brand identity and tone of voice (TOV). As an extension, we crafted brand guidelines, a content style guide, and TOV guidelines (authoritative, yet friendly and informal), allowing Roq to create messaging that’s ‘human’ and easy to understand. 

Roq’s new brand represents much more than a name. The Q symbol represents quality, which is at the heart of everything they do. It depicts how Roq becomes a seamless extension of the businesses they help, understanding their needs. We also updated Roq’s colours to feel more vibrant and fun.

The result? An evolved brand comprising an updated tone of voice and new headless website that reflects the brand’s 10-year vision for growth. This evolution was rolled out across branding, including marketing collateral, powerpoint, icons, and a whitepaper. Thanks to its brand evolution, Roq distinguishes itself from competitors while staying true to its values, mission, and personality across all platforms.
