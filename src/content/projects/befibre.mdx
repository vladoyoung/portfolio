Creating a new brand identity for a future-proof internet provider to ensure it resonates with target audiences.

BeFibre aims to deliver broadband exactly as it should be – no buffering or false promises, just future-proof internet at impressive speeds. Launching the brand in a very competitive and complicated market meant that BeFibre was on the lookout for a creative agency to help pin down its personality and distil it into a robust brand identity.

### The challenge - change the top images

BeFibre has evolved since its conception, creating the need for an exciting new brand. There was demand for refreshed messaging that would speak from the heart and put the customer at the centre, while setting the brand apart in what is an extremely saturated industry. BeFibre was on the lookout for a creative agency that could create a brand identity to help achieve three main objectives; to stand out from the competition, empower customers and improve their quality of life and create a legacy.

BeFibre aims to address the challenges facing broadband users using a bold, creative approach. When we presented a bold, creative and challenging response to their brief during the pitch process, BeFibre saw that our company values aligned and that we’d be the best fit for the brand.

### The solution

We worked closely with our PR partner Scriba to deliver an all-encompassing strategy and onward journey for the brand. Firstly, we held a brand workshop with key stakeholders to uncover what’s important to the people behind BeFibre and learn about the problems it solves for its customers. We were then able to refine customer personas – defining the goals, frustrations, greatest-loved brands and most-used social platforms of BeFibre’s target audiences. 

From all this, we pinned down the brand personality, values and reason for being, which informed the brand identity and tone of voice (TOV). As an extension of this, we crafted brand guidelines, a content style guide and TOV guidelines that are friendly, relatable and a little cheeky, allowing BeFibre to create messaging that’s ‘human’ and resonates with its audiences.
