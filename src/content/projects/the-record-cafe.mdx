### The challenge

The project involved revamping the website and integrating new systems. The client required seamless uploading of new records and website maintenance, all while infusing a modern appearance. The menus were being managed and revised using the "Untappd" platform. Additionally, the café aimed to produce a new video for prospective customers and update its photo gallery. A fresh booking system was essential, enabling customers to provide their details and notifying the café owner about the successful reservation for timely arrangements.

### The solution

Continuous input from the client led to the development of a robust design system that greatly facilitated the website creation process. The website was constructed using WordPress, incorporating multiple plugins for enhanced functionality. To address the record uploading requirement, a plugin was utilized, enabling the conversion of Excel sheets into dynamic content. This plugin enabled the separate uploading of records along with their respective details and images. The menu integration was achieved through the Untappd API, ensuring automatic updates every hour. This synchronization enabled changes made in the Untappd app to be reflected on the website, ensuring efficiency. The booking system was designed as a contact form, triggering notifications to the café owner for prompt record preparation.

Though not a professional photographer or videographer, I ventured into the task and achieved commendable results. The video production spanned three days with various time frames, and the 360 virtual tour was accomplished within one day, followed by stitching for website compatibility. I must admit, the entire experience was highly enjoyable and gratifying!
