Cloud Gateway provides networking and security services to both public and private sectors. They use their unique UK-first SASE platform. They have clients in various fields, including medicine. Cloud Gateway wanted to update their brand and make a new website using the headless approach. This was to help explain their services better, especially to people from different industries. They wanted to make what they do more real and easier to get.

### The challenge

Cloud Gateway wanted to change how they looked and also needed a new website. They needed the new look to help explain their services better, which are divided into three parts: 'connect', 'protect', and 'inspect'. Things related to cloud technology and services can be hard to understand, especially for people who aren't very technical. So, they wanted a new look that could make these ideas easier to understand and more real. This was important because it would help their success keep growing.

The new website also had to work with Salesforce. This would let the team at Cloud Gateway easily take care of finding new customers and making sales. Since we had experience with this kind of work, Cloud Gateway asked us for help, knowing that they would get good support.

### The solution

While designing the website, we quickly realized we could make Cloud Gateway really stand out in their industry. This led us to give their brand a new look, which included making three cloud characters, each with a name and its own personality.

At first, the client was worried that these characters might not seem very 'professional', but the feedback from Cloud Gateway's clients and staff has been really positive. These characters help explain the different parts of what they do in a way that everyone can understand. They also match Cloud Gateway's way of speaking that's direct but also fun. This means the services they offer are now more understandable and real.

We also made a headless website for them, which connects with Salesforce. This website is doing a great job at getting new leads for them.
