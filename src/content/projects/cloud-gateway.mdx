Cloud Gateway offers networking and security services for the public and private sectors powered by its UK first, SASE platform. With clients spanning a range of specialist backgrounds, including medicine, Cloud Gateway needed a rebrand and new headless website that could bring its service offering to life for people across many sectors, making it more tangible and easier to understand.

### The challenge

Along with a new website, Cloud Gateway needed a rebrand that would better explain the different elements of their service offering – ‘connect’, ‘protect’ and ‘inspect’. Cloud infrastructure and technology services can be difficult to understand, especially for those who aren’t particularly technically-minded. Therefore, a rebrand that could bring these concepts to life and make them more tangible was key in enabling the company’s growing success to continue.

The new website would need to integrate with Salesforce, to enable the team at Cloud Gateway to easily and efficiently manage their lead generation and sales. Owing to our previous experience working in this sector, Cloud Gateway approached The Bigger Boat knowing they would be in safe hands.

### The solution

During the website design phase, we quickly realised there was an opportunity to really stand out in Cloud Gateway’s sector. This led to us refreshing the brand, ushering in the creation of three cloud characters – each with their own name and unique personality.

Initially, the client had concerns the characters may not be seen as ‘professional’, but the feedback from Cloud Gateway’s clients and employees has been entirely positive. The characters bring the different elements of the service offering to life in a way that’s relatable to everyone and in line with Cloud Gateway’s straight-talking yet fun tone of voice. The result is they’re more tangible and easier to understand.

We also built a headless website that integrates with Salesforce and is proving to be a top source of lead generation. Going forward, we’ll work with Cloud Gateway to provide marketing strategy and support on retainer.
