Yorkshire Packaging Systems (YPS) has been a leader in packaging machinery and materials for 45 years. They are known for their great skills and smart solutions in many different industries. YPS wanted a website that would show how good they are and how much people respect them.

### The challenge

Due to the high demand for their skills and services, YPS rebranded and got a new headquarters in March 2021. The new brand needed to show on their website too, so they needed a new one. The aim was to have a website that looks great and makes customers happy when they visit. They wanted it to show how good they are. The old website was slow and caused problems for people using it. It also made it harder for people to find YPS on search engines. So, we had to make the new website faster and keep the good work we did to help YPS show up online.

### The solution

We suggested building a headless website for YPS, using Storyblok as the CMS. This type of website has many benefits, including better security and speed. Unlike traditional systems, it doesn't need regular updates or maintenance. It's a great choice for YPS. The website was made to work well on phones and computers. We also reorganized the site to show all the services YPS offers now.

We made the website in parts that can be used on different pages. With Storyblok, it's easy for YPS to change things around. We wanted to make sure YPS could keep track of the leads they get. They can have a lot of important leads in a system called Zoho. We made special content that people need to give their information for, and this connects with Zoho. Then, YPS can work on turning those leads into real customers.

Since the new website started, there's been a 15% increase in leads. People also spend more time on the site, look at more pages, and leave less quickly. It's also easier to find the site on search engines. YPS now appears higher in the results, and 33 keywords are now on the first page of search results.
