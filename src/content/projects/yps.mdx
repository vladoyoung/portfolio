Yorkshire Packaging Systems (YPS) has been leading the way in packaging machinery and materials for 45 years. Offering award-winning expertise and intelligent, tailored solutions across a diverse range of sectors, YPS needed a website that would reflect its capabilities and prestige.

### The challenge

In response to its increasingly sought-after expertise and services, YPS rebranded and moved to a purpose-built headquarters in March 2021. The rebrand had to be mirrored in the company’s online presence too, requiring a new website that would marry up. The goal was a site the team could be proud of, boasting improved visuals and an enhanced online customer experience to better demonstrate their capabilities. With a slow existing WordPress website causing user experience issues and impacting SEO potential, the technical side of our brief was to improve speed and maintain the SEO work we’d done to date.

### The solution

Our recommendation for YPS was a headless website, utilising Storyblok as the CMS. With the benefits of headless website builds including increased security and speed, the absence of version and plugin updates (unlike many other traditional CMS platforms) and no painful ongoing maintenance, a headless website was the ideal solution. Designed to be a seamless experience across mobile and desktop, the site features an updated structure to reflect YPS’ expanded service offering.

We developed a component-based website that allows the team at YPS to re-use any component on any new or existing page. When coupled with Storyblok’s intuitive CMS, we were able to deliver a website offering maximum flexibility and longevity.  Another key consideration was that YPS can have up to millions of pounds worth of lead data in Zoho, which we addressed through the use of gated content that integrates with the Zoho CRM. These leads are then pushed into a system that allows the client to efficiently develop them.

In the month since the website went live, we’ve seen a 15% increase in lead generation to date. User engagement has improved too, with a session duration increase of 30%, pages per session up 18% and bounce rate reduced by 10%. Search engine visibility has also improved across the board, with a 12% improvement in the top five and top 10 positions. Finally, 33 keywords – some of which were the priority for YPS – jumped up to page one.
