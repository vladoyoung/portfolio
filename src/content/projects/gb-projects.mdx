GB Projects supplies large-scale businesses in sectors, including retail and education, across the UK.  This family-run company requested a major brand overhaul to support a new direction in business and better reflect its product offering.

### The challenge

As GB Projects celebrated 45 years of commercial furniture manufacture, it was decided a new identity was required to modernise the firm and support the progressive direction of the business.

We were commissioned to rebrand the business as it looked towards expanding the breadth of markets it already supplies, as well as oversee the design and build of a new website to better showcase its high-specification product offering.
