### The challenge

As GB Projects marked its 45th year in commercial furniture manufacturing, the decision was made to update its identity for a more contemporary image that aligned with the company's forward-looking direction.

Our task was to lead the rebranding effort as the company aimed to broaden its reach in the markets it currently serves. Additionally, we were entrusted with designing and developing a new website that effectively highlights its range of high-quality products.
