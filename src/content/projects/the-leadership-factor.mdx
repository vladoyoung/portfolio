The Leadership Factor (TLF) designs bespoke research programmes for B2B and B2C organisations of all sizes, before supporting its clientele to translate the results into actionable tasks that will help improve their business. The team tasked us with creating a new mobile-responsive website with an improved UI that would make content more discoverable, products easier to buy and the company more transparent.

### The challenge

TLF has a wide range of content, but its existing website meant it wasn’t easy to navigate. Filtering content and finding articles written more than a few months ago was close to impossible, meaning TLF were not maximising all the time and effort that had been put into producing genuinely insightful articles.

Another challenge TLF faced was digitising its Customer Insight magazine. Before the pandemic, this magazine was beautifully designed, printed and delivered to businesses. However, as people moved to work from home, fewer people wanted to provide a personal address and the magazine quickly became almost exclusively read online. Because of this, TLF wanted to move this content away from a simple PDF download and bring it to life online.

After being impressed by our approach to the brief and deciding we’d be a good fit for an ongoing partnership with TLF Research, the client tasked us with designing and building a new content-focused B2B site with ecommerce functionality. Central to this challenge was finding a way to make TLF’s high-value content more discoverable and easily accessible, as well as improving the UI overall and ultimately, generating leads.

### The solution

Firstly, we conducted a website workshop with TLF to discuss the customer journey for its key customer segments. This ensured we’d fully considered the customer experience before deciding on our course of action. Every aspect of the new site structure came about as a result of the workshop.

TLF had thousands of articles on its existing site, which we cut down through data analysis that prioritised high-value content. To help make the wide range of content more discoverable, we housed it in a CX Insights Hub and directed users to it with a prominent CTA anchored at the bottom of the viewport. Dynamic Algolia search was implemented to memorise terms users search for. Over time, this helps with discovery and recommendations, so users can more easily access any information they want to learn more about.

Another key challenge we addressed was digitising TLF’s quarterly Customer Insights magazine. The variety of components we used on the articles help give this section a ‘magazine’ aesthetic and feel, while Algolia search makes the content accessible quickly. What’s more, users can view the latest magazine issue or download previous issues in full as PDFs.

By stripping back the UI, we’ve made all information more accessible to users and improved the cross-device user experience. The overall site navigation is now much clearer for TLF’s services - the four "research pillars" of Quantitative Research, Qualitative Research, Experience Design and Creative Communication. No longer clunky and difficult to use, the site is fully responsive.

It’s now much easier to explore past webinars for free or book on to upcoming live ones, as well as training courses and events on subjects surrounding customer experience. Thanks to the Shopify integration, users can buy products from the TLF store with ease.

Overall, the new website provides a more transparent view of the company, allowing users to see the team they’re working with, along with an explanation of how they work. Finally, the success stories provide an overview of companies TLF has worked with and how they’ve helped.
