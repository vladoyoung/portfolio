### The challenge

This project was a redesign project which consisted of the new design being scoped, revisited and reworked multiple times until the client was satisfied with the results. This process took a couple of weeks until a consensus was reached, but the outcome was very good. The design was easy to use, minimal, modern, and professional.

### The solution

Following the original colour scheme, layouts and structure of the website. I was able to build the new design and integrate it into WordPress. The client then provided some new client and new professional imagery which boosted the look and results of the pages. This project was completed fairly quick, but the results were satisfying.
